  <h1>COMMUNITY GUIDELINES</h1>

  <h3>Be excellent to each other.</h3>
  <p>Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here — and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggressions.</p>

  <h3>Speak up if you see or hear something.</h3>
  <p>Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. Also, assume positive intent. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behavior to their attention is encouraged.</p>

  <h3>Practice saying "Yes and" to each other.</h3>
  <p>Build on each other’s ideas. We all benefit when we create together.</p>

  <h3>We have a <bold>ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY</bold> for harassment of any kind, including but not limited to:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Stalking/following</li>
    <li>Harassing photography or recording</li>
    <li>Deliberate intimidation</li>
    <li>Sustained disruption of talks or other events</li>
    <li>Offensive verbal comments</li>
    <li>Sexual images in public spaces</li>
    <li>Inappropriate physical contact</li>
    <li>Unwelcome sexual or physical attention</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>In relation to, but not limited to:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Neurodiversity</li>
    <li>Race</li>
    <li>Color</li>
    <li>National origin</li>
    <li>Gender</li>
    <li>Gender identity</li>
    <li>Gender presentation</li>
    <li>Sexual orientation</li>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Body size</li>
    <li>Differing abilities</li>
    <li>Appearance</li>
    <li>Religion</li>
    <li>Pregnancy</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We empower and encourage you to report any behavior that makes you or others feel uncomfortable by finding a Google staff member wearing a pink STAFF shirt or a Google speaker wearing a blue Polymer Summit shirt, or by emailing polymer-dev-summit@google.com.</p>

  <p>Any person behaving in a disorderly manner, engaging in harassing or uncomfortable behavior, or otherwise failing to comply with this policy may be removed from any Google-hosted event or refused admittance (including to future Google events) at any time in Google’s sole discretion. Individuals who are expelled from an event for a violation of this policy will not be provided with a refund.</p>

  <h3>ANTI-HARASSMENT POLICY</h3>

  <p>Google is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive conference experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, differing abilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, age, religion, or other protected category. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Google takes these violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately. All attendees of the event must abide by our anti-harassment policy.</p>

  <h3>CONDUCT POLICY</h3>

  <p>Google reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from the event (including future Google events) at any time in its sole discretion. This includes but is not limited to attendees behaving in a disorderly manner or failing to comply with the terms and conditions herein.</p>
