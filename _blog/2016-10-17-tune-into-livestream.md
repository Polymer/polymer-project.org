Welcome to the Polymer Summit [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YFnfYJaqlA) 2016. Today, we’ll kick off with a keynote about how the core Polymer team is thinking about the project’s past, present, and future. We’ll follow with a full day of sessions covering every aspect of building great web applications using Polymer, including a unique new Polymer experience, and thoughts from our partners. Tune into the livestream below to follow along. We look forward to engaging in the conversation with you at #PolymerSummit.
