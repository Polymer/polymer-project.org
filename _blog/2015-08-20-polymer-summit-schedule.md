We’re excited to announce that the full speaker list and talk schedule has been released for the first ever Polymer Summit!  Find the latest details on our newly launched site [here](https://www.polymer-project.org/summit). Look forward to talks about topics like building full apps with Polymer, Polymer and ES6, adaptive UI with Material Design, and performance patterns in Polymer.

The Polymer Summit will start on Monday, September 14th with an evening of Code Labs, followed by a full day of talks on Tuesday, September 15th. All of this will be happening at the Muziekgebouw aan ‘t IJ, right on the IJ river in downtown Amsterdam.  All tickets to the summit were claimed on the first day, but you can [sign up for the waitlist](https://polymer.eventfarm.com/orders/soldOut/7fff5387-0000-4556-a4c1-610d82a69538) to be notified, should any more tickets become available.
