We're excited to announce the first release candidate for lit-html 1.0!

If you've been following along, you know that lit-html is an efficient, expressive, extensible HTML templating library for JavaScript – one of the foundations of our lighter, simpler next-generation product offerings.

Weighing in at just over 3k minified & gzipped, lit-html takes advantage of two modern web platform features to do its heavy lifting: JavaScript [Tagged Template Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) and [HTML Template Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template). In the future, lit-html will likely become even lighter, as it is based on the ideas underlying the emerging HTML Template Instantiation proposal.

We first introduced lit-html in August 2017. Since then, we've been working with early adopters to put it through its paces and refine it based on real-world usage. Over the last few months, we've been driving hard toward a 1.0 release, making a final set of changes aimed at stabilizing the API and hardening the implementation for widespread use in production.  At this point, we have no further breaking API changes planned, and consider it in a "release candidate" state.

We encourage you to try out lit-html 1.0.0-rc.1 and report any issues you find. Barring any showstoppers, we're targeting a formal 1.0 release within the next few weeks. Meanwhile, stay tuned for updates on our related next-gen products: LitElement, Material Web Components and PWA Starter Kit.
