Join us for the third annual Polymer Summit 2017 to catch up on the latest developments in the world of Polymer and web components.

This year's summit takes place August 22–23 at [Lokomotivværkstedet](http://www.lvcph.dk/index-eng.html) in beautiful downtown [Copenhagen, Denmark](https://goo.gl/maps/pgFPsEkRRcS2).

Like previous years, we'll have talks and codelabs from the Polymer team, plus food, fun, and plenty of space for informal conversations.

For the first time this year, we'll be asking for talks from community members, so we can hear from you, too.

To be notified when registration opens, sign up with your email address at [g.co/polymersummit2017](http://g.co/polymersummit2017). As always, tickets are  free.

If you can't make it to Copenhagen, don't worry. The talks will be livestreamed and recorded for later, and the codelabs will be available online so you can try them out from anywhere.

Follow us on Twitter [@polymer](https://twitter.com/polymer) for regular updates.
