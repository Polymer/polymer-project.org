_We announce significant releases here on the blog, highlighting the major new features as well as breaking changes. As always, we'd love to get your feedback, issues, and PR's, so tweet us [@polymer](https://twitter.com/polymer) or contribute to the [Github](https://github.com/Polymer)._


The [1.2.0 release](https://github.com/polymer/polymer/releases/tag/v1.2.0) includes two significant new features:

- Compound bindings. At long last, string interpolation in bindings.

- Effective children and node observers. New features for querying and tracking changes to your light DOM children.

## Compound bindings

This release delivers one of the most-asked-for features in Polymer data binding: string interpolation, or "compound bindings." You can now embed multiple binding expressions in a single string:

```
<div>first name: [[name.first]] last name: [[name.last]]</div>
````

Compound bindings can eliminate the need for computed bindings in many cases.

Note that you can use either one-way ( `[[]]` ) or automatic ( `{% raw %}{{}}{% endraw %}` ) binding annotations in a compound binding, but the bindings are **always one-way, host-to-target.**

## Distributed nodes, effective children

Often, a custom element needs to know about its light DOM children. This release includes two new APIs related to children:

- Effective children. A new set of APIs provide a way to access an element's "effective children" &mdash; the child list with any `<content>` elements replaced by their distributed children.
- `observeNodes`. A new method that lets you register for notification when an element's effective children or distributed children change.

To understand these new APIs, you first need to understand distributed children.

The Polymer DOM API supports the `getDistributedNodes` method, which returns a list of child nodes distributed to a given insertion point (`<content>` element).

But what about custom elements with no local DOM? or if you want to find light DOM children that haven't been distributed to _any_ insertion point? That's when you need the effective children APIs.

Consider a simple image carousel element with no local DOM. It's used like this:

```
<simple-carousel>
  <img src="one.jpg">
  <img src="two.jpg">
  <img src="three.jpg">
<simple-carousel>
```

The carousel adds dots underneath the current image that let the user select a different image, so the carousel needs to know how many children it has. This is simple enough: the carousel can check its children the `attached` method:

```js
attached: function() {
  this.childcount = Polymer.dom(this).children.length;
  // do something with childcount ...
}
```

But there are a few issues here. What if you create a new element, `<popup-carousel>`, that includes a simple carousel in its local DOM? You use the new element the same way:

```
<popup-carousel>
  <img src="one.jpg">
  <img src="two.jpg">
</popup-carousel>
```

Internally, the popup-carousel does something like this:

```
<dom-module id="popup-carousel">
  <template>
    <simple-carousel>
      <content></content>
    </simple-carousel>
  </template>
  ...
</dom-module>
```

The popup carousel simply passes its children on to the simple carousel by including a `<content>` tag. But now the simple carousel's `attached` method doesn't work: `Polymer.dom(this).children.length` will always return 1, because the carousel only has a single child, the `<content>` tag.

Clearly, `children` isn't what you want here. you want a list of children, with any `<content>` tags replaced by their distributed children. Unfortunately, the platform doesn't have a primitive for this, so Polymer has added the concept of "effective children" in its DOM API.

You can now retrieve an element's effective child nodes using:

```js
var effectiveChildren = Polymer.dom(element).getEffectiveChildNodes();
```

For convenience, several new methods are available on the Polymer element prototype:

- `getEffeciveChildNodes()`. Returns a list of effective child nodes for this element.
- `getEffectiveChildren()`. Returns a list of effective child elements for this element.
- `queryEffectiveChildren(selector)`. Returns the first effective child that matches `selector`.
- `queryAllEffectiveChildren(selector)`. Returns a list of effective children that match `selector`.

Replacing `children` with the `getEffectiveChildren` method gives you the result you want:

```js
this.childcount = this.getEffectiveChildren().length;
```

You can think of `getEffectiveChildren` as a composition-friendly version of `children`.

### Effective children versus distributed children

For the simple case, if your element has a single `<content>` tag with
no `select` attribute, calling `getEffectiveChildNodes` on your element
gives **the same results** as `getDistributedNodes` on the content element. All effective child nodes are distributed to the content element:

```
<dom-module id="simple-content">

  <template>
    <content id="mycontent"></content>
  </template>
  <script>
    Polymer({
      is: 'simple-content',
      ready: {
        // these two calls return the same information
        var effective = this.getEffectiveChildNodes();
        var distributed = Polymer.dom(this.$.mycontent).getDistributedNodes();
      }
    });
  </script>
</dom-module>
```


## But what about runtime DOM changes?

Of course, there's another problem with checking the child list in `ready` or `attached`, what happens if someone adds adds or removes a child at runtime? Your element should handle that, too.

The `observeNodes` method provides a local-DOM-aware method to monitor DOM changes.

```js
this._observer = Polymer.dom(node).observeNodes(function(info) {
  this.processNewNodes(info.addedNodes);
  this.processRemovedNodes(info.removedNodes);
});
```

`observeNodes` takes a callback that takes an `info` object. The `info` object includes `addedNodes` and `removedNodes` arrays. Unlike a mutation observer, the `observeNodes` callback is only invoked for added and removed nodes, not for other changes.

The method returns a handle that can be used to stop observation:

```js
    Polymer.dom(node).unobserveNodes(this._observer);
```

The `observeNodes` method behaves slightly differently depending on the
node being observed:

-   If the node being observed is a _content node_, the callback is called when the content node's _distributed children_ change.
-   For any other node, the callback is called when the node's _effective children_ change.

A few notes on `observeNodes`:

-   Since the method is attached to the DOM API, the callback is called the observed node as the `this` value. so if you do:

```js
this._observer = Polymer.dom(this.$.content).observeNodes(_childrenchanged);
```

The callback is invoked with `this.$.content` as the `this` value. If you want to use the custom element as the `this` value, you need to bind the callback:

```js
var boundHandler = this._childNodesChanged.bind(this);
this._observer = Polymer.dom(this.$.content).observeNodes(boundHandler);
```

-   Like a mutation observer, the callback argument lists added and removed nodes,
    not just elements. If you're only interested in elements, you can filter the
    node list:

```js
info.addedNodes.filter(function(node) {
  return (node.nodeType === node.ELEMENT_NODE)
});
```

-   The first callback from `observeNodes` contains **all** nodes added to the element,
    _not_ the elements added since `observeNodes` was called. this works well if you're using `observeNodes` exclusively.

    If you need to synchronously process the element's children -- for example, in `attached`, and then use `observeNodes` to monitor changes to the child list, you may need to be aware of this.


### Why not just a mutation observer?

If you're familiar with mutation observers, you may wonder why you can't just use a mutation observer to handle DOM changes.

For the simple case, you can use a mutation observer to detect when children are added or removed from your element. However, mutation observers have the same limitation as the `children` list: they don't reflect local DOM distributions. In the case of the `<popup-carousel>` example, adding a child to `<popup-carousel>` wouldn't trigger a mutation observer on `<simple-carousel>`.

To detect those changes, `<simple-carousel>` would have to check its child list for `<content>` nodes. If it's got a `<content>` node in its `children`, it would need to add _another_ mutation observer on its shadow host (in this case, `<popup-carousel>`). And so on. Suddenly, the `<simple-carousel>` isn't so simple anymore.

The `observeNodes` method handles this complexity for you. It uses mutation observers internally to track DOM changes, and handles the extra bookkeeping required to track local DOM distributions. Unlike a mutation observer, the `observeNodes` callback is only invoked when nodes are added or removed &mdash; it doesn't handle attribute changes or character data changes.
